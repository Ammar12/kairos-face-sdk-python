# kairos-face-sdk-python
Kairos Face Recognition API Python Client Library

## Installation
`pip install .` inside the project root directory

## Usage
I'll soon add a sample application to the project, but for now you can take a look at the integration test in order to have an idea about how the library is supposed to be used :)
